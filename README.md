#VeevaThumb

_Viva la Veeva!_

Exports thumbnails for "Veeva" eDetailing presentations via Photoshop JavaScript API. For use within Photoshop CS6 or CC.

#####Instructions

* Open all images you wish to export in Photoshop CS6/CC (images must already be saved on your machine somewhere, otherwise the script won't work). The filename extension of your images does not matter.
* Open "File > Scripts > Browse".
* Find "VeevaThumb.js" in the browse window and load it (note: Photoshop's default scripting file type is .jsx, make sure to search for .js in the dropdown list).
* Once loaded, you will be prompted to choose a file size: type "1" for 1024x768 or "2" for 200x150, then select "OK". Export units are pixels only.
* After this step, all images currently open in Photoshop will be exported as a .jpg with the requested dimensions.
* Exported images will be stored in the root folder of the original source images, so I suggest creating a separate folder in your desktop for this operation and storing the images in there to keep things organized.
